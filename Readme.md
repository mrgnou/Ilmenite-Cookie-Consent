# Ilmenite Cookie Consent
A simple, developer-friendly WordPress plugin that lets visitors know that the site is using cookies.

There are many WordPress plugins out there which does a lot of fancy things with the cookie consent. We didn't find one we really liked that was really lightweight and developer friendly and so we created our own.

It isn't meant for the masses who want tons of configurable options in the admin (although it will work and look fine out of the box). Many use this plugin with the default styling because it is so light-weight and good-looking.

For the developer who wants the functionality and being able to convenietly override the styles in the theme without bloat—here's a plugin for you. You have filters and actions available to you at every step of the process.

## Configuration
The plugin works out of the box with minimal settings. However here are a few things you will probably want to be aware about.

### Set the policy link
You can set the URL to the cookie policy page in the customizer under the "Site Identity" section.

### Custom Styling
Out of the box, the plugin includes a lightweight stylesheet. If you don't want to use our default coloring, you can easily prevent us from including the styles.

Just define the following filter somewhere in your code, such as the theme functions.php file:

    add_filter( 'ilcc_load_stylesheet', '__return_false' );

### Changing the text and/or the button label.
To change the text in the consent banner and/or the button label, there are two filters: ilcc_consent_text and ilcc_accept_text.

Just set their value somewhere in your code, such as in the functions.php file of your theme:

    function ilcc_modify_consent_text( $text ) {
        $text = __( 'This is my custom text about how we use cookies.', 'YOURTEXTDOMAIN' );
        return $text;
    }

    add_filter( 'ilcc_consent_text', 'ilcc_modify_consent_text' );

    function ilcc_modify_accept_text( $text ) {
        $text = __( 'I Accept', 'YOURTEXTDOMAIN' );
        return $text;
    }

    add_filter( 'ilcc_accept_text', 'ilcc_modify_accept_text' );

### List of Actions

`ilcc_loaded` - Runs on constructor.

`before_ilcc_init` - Runs before we have run any init actions.

`ilcc_init` - Runs when all init hooks have run.

### List of Filters

`ilcc_policy_url` - Allows you to modify the Policy URL. Has the url from the options as argument.

`ilcc_edit_policy_url_capability` - Allows you to modify which capability is required for editing the policy URL in the customizer. Defaults to `edit_theme_options`.

## Translations
Included in the package are translations for the following languages:

- Danish (Thanks Magnus)
- German (Thanks Frank)
- Hungarian (Thanks Miklos)
- Italian (Thanks Matteo)
- Lithuanian
- Norwegian (Thanks Kristofer)
- Slovak (Thanks Peter)
- Spanish (Thanks Vigdis & Ibertrix)
- Swedish

A complete *.pot* file is available in the *translations/* directory. If you use and translate this little plugin, please send us the translation so it can be included!

**Even better** is if you use Translate.WordPress.org for your translations. That way, they will be automatically distributed with the WordPress updater.

However, in some locales, the work with the Translate site is not up to speed. We will continue to support bundled translations because of this.
